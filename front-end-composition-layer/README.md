This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

## Development environment
To start run the `npm start`.

## Mocking the rest api
For supporting the isolated development we are using the [json-server](https://github.com/typicode/json-server)
To serve the mock data run `npm run "start mock server"`. 

If you wish to change the served data modify the `./src/mockDb/db.json file`
